                        <p>This game "Property Tycoon" acted as very similar of a game as "Monopoly", with the goals being the same. There were specifics rules for 
                            this assignment which were different rules to Monopoly, but it functioned the same.</p>
                        <p>Property Tycoon could hold up to 5 players at once, with 4 AI controlled units available to be used. </p>
                        <p>There were 2 types of cards, "Pot Luck" and "Opportunity Knocks" cards, which acted as Chance and Community Chest cards from Monopoly. </p>

                        <p>There were 3 main areas that needed work, the first was in fact the design of the UI, which took a significant amount of time to complete. </p>
                        <p>The second was the background programming to import all the information into the game and have it displayed in the correct position.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the programming to enable the players to move around the board, and manage all the data was very important.</p>

                        <p>I gained experience working in multiple areas. One was working in an Agile development timeline, working towards prototypes regularly rather than a slower waterfall process. 
                            Another was working in a larger group, and learning to manage different responsibilities. Additionally, having to design tests was very useful, as I learned better techniques
                        than simply using statements written to the console, such as Unity's inbuilt Unit Tests. </p>

                        <h6 class="card-title">The Task</h6>
                        <p>As part of my A level in Computer Science, I had to create a project of some kind for my final year report. </p>
                        <p>What I decided on creating was a game built without using a game engine, to give me invaluable experience into understanding how games are made.</p>
                        <p>Although the end product was something not very "game" like, and more more of a demo of features, I was incredibly proud of the game, considering I had created all the UI 
                            and gameplay components, textures and imported the audio all without use of a Game Engine, and instead using TkInter to code the UI and other elements in Python, all while learning methods of Class based programming as a result. </p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-3">
                <div class="card mb-4">

                        <h6 class="card-title">Features</h6>
                        <p>When working on this project, there were many features made to create the kind of game I wanted to make. These were,</p>
                        <p>-A login screen, which allowed players to store and load their previous characters.</p>
                        <p>-A music selection system, and switching between audios. </p>
                        <p>-A pixel based game, where 2d sprites are animated to simulate movement.</p>
                        <p>-A game world designed on a tile-by-tile basis, where a map could be changed with a simple file change. </p>
                        <p>-A game world that visualised backgrounds and foregrounds, and allowed characters to move in 2.5 dimensions (meaning, behind or through objects)</p>
                        <p>These features were the most important to me, and although I successfully completed them, I still wish I had the knowledge I do now to create a more complex and compelling game.</p>

                </div>

                        <h2 class="mb-4"><i class="ti-gallery text-primary"></i></h2>
                        <h6 class="card-title">Inspirations</h6>
                        <p>There were two key inspirations for this game, which I used and kept in mind for the creation of the game itself.</p>
                        <p>These two games were</p>
                        <p>Pokemon Games (Various) -  These various Pokemon games (E.g. Pokemon Red, Black, White, Platinum) used a very specific style of pixel art, which I always found charming and I thought would work perfectly for my idea of a game. </p>
                        <p>Minecraft - Minecraft gave a key inspiration for how I would create the world, having everything be on a "block by block" instead of "tile by tile" basis. This meant that natural structures
                            or even created ones such as a moat, could be built up using the tiles of the game world, rather than importing a specific texture for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>These culminated in the design scheme that I chose, although I had many further ideas to implement at the time.</p>

                        <h6 class="card-title">Problems that arose</h6>
                        <p>The biggest problem was that I had never seriously coded before starting this project, and unfortunately, I had two computer science teachers which switched out part way through each year.
                        </p><p>As a result, I ended up creating this with very little guidance, and without much outside help aside from a few youtube tutorials which I discovered towards the end of the project. </p>
                        <p>A next big problem that I encountered was learning to deal with class based programming without any guidance. This was especially difficult for me, working in Python, and as my first 
                            programming language, but I decided to persevere through it and ended up understanding class based programming relatively well by the time I finished school.
